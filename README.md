# PokemonBattleSimulator
This is similar to my "Program your own Chess" project. It is a Pokemon Battling program where I have intentionally left two functions incomplete to allow someone (such as a student of mine) to program some of the game logic however they see fit. They are free to add functionality for types, how much damage is done, which Pokemon attacks first, etc.
